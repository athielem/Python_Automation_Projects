# Overview

I set up this repo to pursue **different automation tasks with Python** that are of professional interest to me to 1) let the machine do manual work for me and 2) display my proficiency with the programming language.

I intend on tackling the following **challenges**:
- create auomatic **newsletter** with headlines of articles from www.versicherungswirtschaft-heute.de
- Create a **website** with which an individual can sign up for the newsletter
- save headlines into a **database** that can be accessed for analytical purposes
- **classify articles** according to their relevance (*of all articles, tell me which article I should start reading first?*)
